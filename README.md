This repository demonstrates a common error in Kotlin involving ConcurrentModificationException. The `bug.kt` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.kt` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from modifying a collection (a mutable set in this case) while iterating over it using an iterator.  The solution showcases safe ways to remove elements during iteration, avoiding the exception.
